  Maintaining a healthy brain during one's life is the uppermost goal in
  pursuing health and longevity. As the population ages, <br />
  the burden of neurological disorders and challenges for the preservation
  of brain health increase.<br />
  It is therefore vital to understand what brain health is. <br />
  With the increase in the number of brain related disorders we present our
  vision to <br />
  develop an automated tool to deal with this problem where we analyze the
  EEG signals <br />
  generated by the brain to check sleep patterns, alcoholism and depressive
  behavior. <br> 
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recorded in the classic 10-20
  EEG system where electrodes <br />
  are positioned in such a way that distance between any two adjacent
  electrodes is between 10% <br />
  to 20% of the total front-back or left-right distance of the skull. This
  method helps in proper examination of the <br />
  patient as it is capable of covering a large portion of the brain with as
  few electrodes as possible. <br />

</div>

<p>
  The EEG readings obtained for the study are basically the voltage
  difference between any two electrodes. <br />
  For example, the reading Fz-Pz shall correspond to the voltage difference
  between the electrodes at position Fz and Pz.<br />

<h3>The average bandpower of an EEG signal</h3>

<p
  >One of the most widely used method to analyze EEG data is to decompose
  the signal into functionally distinct frequency bands,<br />
  such as delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30
  Hz), and gamma (30-100 Hz).<br />
</p>

<h3>Brain waves:</h3>

<div class="img-container">
<img src="static/images/3.png" width="500" height="300" alt="brain waves" /> <br />
</div>

<p
  >This implies the decomposition of the EEG signal into frequency
  components, which is commonly achieved <br />
  through Fourier transforms. The almost invariably used algorithm to
  compute the Fourier transform <br />
  (and arguably the most important signal processing algorithm) is the Fast
  Fourier Transform (FFT), which returns,<br />
  for each frequency bin, a complex number from which one can then easily
  extract the amplitude and phase of the signal at<br />
  that specific frequency. In spectral analysis, it is then common to take
  the magnitude-squared of the FFT to<br />
  obtain an estimate of the power spectral density (or power spectrum, or
  periodogram), expressed in (micro)-Volts per Hertz <br />
  in the case of EEG data.<br /> 
  <br>
  <strong> Data : </strong> The dataset for deployment of various models
  described ahead were obtained<br />
  from the public domain of physionet and we have used the sleep dataset
  available. <br />
</p>

<p
  >We obtained the data of thiry(30) patients from the available dataset and
  used it for our study.</p

<br />

<h3> Models Implemented : </h3>

<p>Using the same dataset, we developed different models to infer which model can perform
  better <br>
  and thus can be used towards the development of our brain analysis tool. The models
implemented are - <br>
<ul>
<li>Multi Layer Neural Network</li>
<li>Convolution Neural Network</li>
<li>Long Short Term Memory Network</li>
<li>Fuzzy Neural Network</li>
<li>Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Network</li>
</ul> </p>

<h2> Methodology </h2>
<ol>
<li>Loading Data :</li>
<p2>The recordings from Sleep Physionet dataset are available in edf format. To begin
computation activity on the data,<br>
we need to load the data into a Raw object
(mne.io.Raw) containing the EEG and annotations. <br> </p2>

<li>Filtering of Data :</li>
<p2> Most of the time, the recorded EEG Signals have some data which are beyond the
extremities <br>
during a normal procedure. These ambiguous readings are called noise which
are caused because of <br>
technical issues. This noise needs to be filtered out before any
computations. We apply a Low-Pass Filter <br>
where we filter out any frequency above
30Hz.<br> </p2>
<li>Extraction Of Epochs & Windowing:</li>
<p2> The recordings are available in 30s windows. We extract the non-overlapping epochs
from the <br>
dataset and convert each extracted epoch as a PyTorch dataset.
All these PyTorch converted <br>
epochs are now concatenated into a single dataset. <br> </p2>

<li> Making the Data Ready for Models:</li>
<p2>Each data in the dataset consists of the following :-  <br>
<strong>a) 2-D array consisting of 2 rows and 3000 columns :- </strong> The rows represent the
features and the columns represent <br>
second-wise voltage readings. <br>
<strong> b) Integer values ranging from 0 to 4 :- </strong>This single value denotes the state of sleep of
the patient as follows - <br>
<ol type="1">
<li> Wakefulness </li>
<li> Light Sleep </li>
<li> Deeper Sleep </li>
<li> Deep Sleep </li>
<li> Rapid Eye Movement </li>
</ol> 
</p2>

<p2> These two data are extracted into different lists. <br>
The first list which contains 2-D arrays cannot be directly fed to any models. <br> 
We use statistical tools to compute the Average Power Spectrum Density to compute 
the average psd of each signal <br> and store it in a suitable manner.
Now our data is ready to be fed to different models. <br>
